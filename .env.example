Creating an environment variables template involves listing common configuration variables that can vary between development, testing, and production environments. Here's a template for a Node.js application, which can easily be adapted for other types of applications:

```bash
# .env.example

# General configuration
NODE_ENV=development # Can be development, production, or test

# Server configuration
PORT=3000 # Default port the application will run on

# Database configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432 # Default port for PostgreSQL
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name

# Authentication secrets
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# API keys (replace with the actual keys)
API_KEY=your_service_api_key

# Email configuration
EMAIL_SERVICE=Gmail # Example: Gmail, SendGrid, Mailgun
EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password

# External services
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info # Can be error, warn, info, verbose, debug, silly

# Additional configurations
# Add any other environment-specific settings here
```

### Instructions

- **Duplication:** Copy this template to a file named `.env` to use it in your development environment. Fill in the actual values for your application's configuration.
- **Security:** Never commit the `.env` file with sensitive data to your version control system. Instead, include the `.env.example` in your repository as a reference.
- **Production:** In a production environment, set environment variables directly in the hosting platform settings or container orchestration system (like Docker, Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, etc.).
- **Access:** Use a library like `dotenv` in Node.js to load these variables into `process.env`. For example:
  ```javascript
  require('dotenv').config();
  ```

Adjust the template as needed to fit the specific requirements and services of your application.
